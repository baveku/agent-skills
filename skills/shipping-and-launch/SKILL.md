# Shipping and Launch

## Overview

Ship with confidence. The goal is not just to deploy — it's to deploy safely, with monitoring in place, a rollback plan ready, and a clear understanding of what success looks like. Every launch should be reversible, observable, and incremental.

## When to Use

- Deploying a feature to production for the first time
- Releasing a significant change to users
- Migrating data or infrastructure
- Opening a beta or early access program
- Any deployment that carries risk (all of them)

## The Pre-Launch Checklist

### Code Quality

- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Build succeeds with no warnings
- [ ] Lint and type checking pass
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] No TODO comments that should be resolved before launch
- [ ] No `console.log` debugging statements in production code
- [ ] Error handling covers expected failure modes
- [ ] `xcodebuild test` passes on CI (or `swift test` for SPM packages)

## Feature Flag Strategy

Ship behind feature flags to decouple deployment from release:

```typescript
// Feature flag check
const flags = await getFeatureFlags(userId);

if (flags.taskSharing) {
  // New feature: task sharing
  return <TaskSharingPanel task={task} />;
}

// Default: existing behavior
return null;
```

#### Apple (Swift)

```swift
// Feature flag check (Firebase Remote Config, LaunchDarkly, or custom)
let flags = try await FeatureFlags.fetch(for: userId)

if flags.taskSharing {
    TaskSharingView(task: task)
} else {
    EmptyView()
}
```

**Feature flag lifecycle:**

```
1. DEPLOY with flag OFF     → Code is in production but inactive
2. ENABLE for team/beta     → Internal testing in production environment
3. GRADUAL ROLLOUT          → 5% → 25% → 50% → 100% of users
4. MONITOR at each stage    → Watch error rates, performance, user feedback
5. CLEAN UP                 → Remove flag and dead code path after full rollout
```

**Rules:**
- Every feature flag has an owner and an expiration date
- Clean up flags within 2 weeks of full rollout
- Don't nest feature flags (creates exponential combinations)
- Test both flag states (on and off) in CI

## Staged Rollout

### The Rollout Sequence

```
1. DEPLOY to staging
   └── Full test suite in staging environment
   └── Manual smoke test of critical flows

2. DEPLOY to production (feature flag OFF)
   └── Verify deployment succeeded (health check)
   └── Check error monitoring (no new errors)

3. ENABLE for team (flag ON for internal users)
   └── Team uses the feature in production
   └── 24-hour monitoring window

4. CANARY rollout (flag ON for 5% of users)
   └── Monitor error rates, latency, user behavior
   └── Compare metrics: canary vs. baseline
   └── 24-48 hour monitoring window
   └── Advance only if all thresholds pass (see table below)

5. GRADUAL increase (25% -> 50% -> 100%)
   └── Same monitoring at each step
   └── Ability to roll back to previous percentage at any point

6. FULL rollout (flag ON for all users)
   └── Monitor for 1 week
   └── Clean up feature flag
```

### Apple-Specific Rollout

```
1. INTERNAL TESTING (App Store Connect → TestFlight → Internal Group)
   └── Up to 100 internal testers, no review required
   └── Test critical flows on real devices

2. EXTERNAL TESTING (TestFlight → External Group)
   └── Requires Beta App Review (usually 24-48h)
   └── Up to 10,000 external testers
   └── Collect crash reports via Xcode Organizer

3. APP STORE REVIEW
   └── Submit for review with complete metadata
   └── Review typically 24-48h
   └── Respond to rejections promptly with specific fixes

4. PHASED RELEASE (App Store Connect → Phased Release)
   └── Day 1: 1% → Day 2: 2% → Day 3: 5% → Day 4: 10% → Day 5: 20% → Day 6: 50% → Day 7: 100%
   └── Monitor crash-free rate in Xcode Organizer
   └── Pause phased release if crash rate spikes
   └── Can halt and resume at any stage

5. POST-LAUNCH MONITORING
   └── Xcode Organizer: crash reports, energy, launch time, hang rate
   └── MetricKit payloads forwarded to backend
   └── App Store Connect: ratings, reviews, crash-free sessions
```

### Rollout Decision Thresholds

Use these thresholds to decide whether to advance, hold, or roll back at each stage:

| Metric | Advance (green) | Hold and investigate (yellow) | Roll back (red) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Error rate | Within 10% of baseline | 10-100% above baseline | >2x baseline |
| P95 latency | Within 20% of baseline | 20-50% above baseline | >50% above baseline |
| Client JS errors | No new error types | New errors at <0.1% of sessions | New errors at >0.1% of sessions |
| Business metrics | Neutral or positive | Decline <5% (may be noise) | Decline >5% |

### When to Roll Back

Roll back immediately if:
- Error rate increases by more than 2x baseline
- P95 latency increases by more than 50%
- User-reported issues spike
- Data integrity issues detected
- Security vulnerability discovered

## Monitoring and Observability

### What to Monitor

```
Application metrics:
├── Error rate (total and by endpoint)
├── Response time (p50, p95, p99)
├── Request volume
├── Active users
└── Key business metrics (conversion, engagement)

Infrastructure metrics:
├── CPU and memory utilization
├── Database connection pool usage
├── Disk space
├── Network latency
└── Queue depth (if applicable)

Client metrics:
├── Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS)
├── JavaScript errors
├── API error rates from client perspective
└── Page load time
```

### Error Reporting

```typescript
// Set up error boundary with reporting
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error: Error, info: React.ErrorInfo) {
    // Report to error tracking service
    reportError(error, {
      componentStack: info.componentStack,
      userId: getCurrentUser()?.id,
      page: window.location.pathname,
    });
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <ErrorFallback onRetry={() => this.setState({ hasError: false })} />;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

// Server-side error reporting
app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  reportError(err, {
    method: req.method,
    url: req.url,
    userId: req.user?.id,
  });

  // Don't expose internals to users
  res.status(500).json({
    error: { code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR', message: 'Something went wrong' },
  });
});
```

#### Apple (Swift)

```swift
import MetricKit
import os

private let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.app", category: "errors")

class CrashReporter: NSObject, MXMetricManagerSubscriber {
    func didReceive(_ payloads: [MXDiagnosticPayload]) {
        for payload in payloads {
            if let crashDiagnostics = payload.crashDiagnostics {
                for crash in crashDiagnostics {
                    ErrorTracker.report(crash.callStackTree)
                }
            }
            if let hangDiagnostics = payload.hangDiagnostics {
                for hang in hangDiagnostics {
                    logger.error("Hang detected: duration=\(hang.hangDuration)")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Post-Launch Verification

In the first hour after launch:

```
1. Check health endpoint returns 200
2. Check error monitoring dashboard (no new error types)
3. Check latency dashboard (no regression)
4. Test the critical user flow manually
5. Verify logs are flowing and readable
6. Confirm rollback mechanism works (dry run if possible)
```

## Rollback Strategy

Every deployment needs a rollback plan before it happens:

```markdown
## Rollback Plan for [Feature/Release]

### Trigger Conditions
- Error rate > 2x baseline
- P95 latency > [X]ms
- User reports of [specific issue]

### Rollback Steps
1. Disable feature flag (if applicable)
   OR
1. Deploy previous version: `git revert <commit> && git push`
2. Verify rollback: health check, error monitoring
3. Communicate: notify team of rollback

### Database Considerations
- Migration [X] has a rollback: `npx prisma migrate rollback`
- Data inserted by new feature: [preserved / cleaned up]

### Time to Rollback
- Feature flag: < 1 minute
- Redeploy previous version: < 5 minutes
- Database rollback: < 15 minutes
```

### Apple Rollback Options

```
Rollback options (Apple):
├── Phased release → Pause immediately in App Store Connect
├── Critical fix → Submit expedited review (App Store Connect → Request Expedited Review)
├── Feature flag → Disable server-side flag (instant, no new build)
├── Remove from sale → Last resort, removes app from App Store entirely
└── TestFlight → Push a fixed beta build while review is pending

Note: Apple does NOT allow reverting to a previous binary.
The only rollback is shipping a new fixed version.
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It works in staging, it'll work in production" | Production has different data, traffic patterns, and edge cases. Monitor after deploy. |
| "We don't need feature flags for this" | Every feature benefits from a kill switch. Even "simple" changes can break things. |
| "Monitoring is overhead" | Not having monitoring means you discover problems from user complaints instead of dashboards. |
| "We'll add monitoring later" | Add it before launch. You can't debug what you can't see. |
| "Rolling back is admitting failure" | Rolling back is responsible engineering. Shipping a broken feature is the failure. |

## Red Flags

- Deploying without a rollback plan
- No monitoring or error reporting in production
- Big-bang releases (everything at once, no staging)
- Feature flags with no expiration or owner
- No one monitoring the deploy for the first hour
- Production environment configuration done by memory, not code
- "It's Friday afternoon, let's ship it"
